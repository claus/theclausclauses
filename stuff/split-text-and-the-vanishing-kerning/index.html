<h1>Split Text and the Vanishing Kerning</h1>
<p>
    So we ran into a little problem recently. For the new incarnation of our website, we were
    experimenting with text effects on headlines. They should have the glyphs of certain
    characters animated, some automatically, some on hover. A new font was created, and we
    discussed how to best implement this. We floated the idea of replacing characters with
    <a href="https://lottiefiles.com/" target="_blank">Lottie</a> animations,
    but soon dismissed it in favor of using
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide" target="_blank">variable fonts</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Glyph animations could be baked right into the font, we could also have multiple
    animations per glyph, or even multiple glyphs per character. Screenreaders and search engine
    crawlers would just see the plain text. I'd wrap each character in a span, apply some CSS
    and be done.
    Perfect!
</p>
<p>
    And we got to work. Andy, our Creative Director, worked on the variable font, and I wrote
    a little web tool that allowed him to preview his work, by selecting various features and
    animating any available axis of the variable font for each character.
</p>
<p>
    One day Andy slacked me:
    <blockquote>
        Here is the latest version of the font with the kerning and animations in. One thing
        that is strange is that when I start the animation with it, the letters jump out
        (possibly losing their kerning?). Any thoughts?
    </blockquote>
    I had noticed that too, but first assumed it was some weird bug in my code or something.
</p>
<p>
    Turns out, <strong>browsers nope out of kerning as soon as adjacent characters have different
    font styles applied to them</strong>. That's Chrome and Firefox. Safari nopes out no matter
    what<a href="#footnote1" aria-label="Footnote 1">1</a>.
    And it makes sense.
    If you have a character pair where one of them is <code>1em</code> high and the other
    <code>3em</code>, what kerning value should the browser apply?
</p>
<p>
    In practice this means that even for an inconspicious
    <code>&lt;span>Hello &lt;b>World&lt;/b>!&lt;/span></code>,
    browsers won't apply kerning on the character pairs
    <code>(space)</code>/<code>W</code>
    and
    <code>d</code>/<code>!</code>,
    because the <code>World</code> is bold and the rest is not.
    Different font styles, no kerning. And Safari won't even try.
</p>
<p>
    That becomes a real problem when using text splitters like
    <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText/" target="_blank">GSAP's SplitText</a>.
    In <a href="https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/pEKYVz" target="_blank">this official GSAP SplitText demo</a>,
    first click the "chars" button, and then the "revert" button. The former splits the text and
    kerning is lost. The latter restores the original markup and kerning is applied again.
</p>
<p>
    Poor Andy.
    <blockquote>
        So much for that week of setting all the kerning. Over 1,200 kerning pairs
        <span class="emoji">🫠</span>
    </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
    I had to find a way.

<section>
<h2 id="intermission">Intermission</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Before we even start, we have to look into how to split a string of text into individual
    characters in JavaScript. You might think that this is trivial, but oh lordy.
</p>
<p>
    Here's some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalgo_text" target="_blank">Zalgo</a> for you:
</p>
<p class="zalgo">
    C̵̫̖͚̗̣͖͚̦͋̆̈́͊̌̒͌r̸̥̯͂͂̆̐̎̋̀ͅa̸̳̜̠̹̪͈͐̅͂z̵̨̨̡̧̡̫̙̥͎͊̓̏̿͆̑̇̀͝y̶͙̦̰͎̓̐̓̎͘͜
</p>
<p>
    That's the word "Crazy" with a whole bunch of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic" target="_blank">diacritics</a>
    added to it. It's five characters, but the <code>.length</code> of that string is <code>72</code>.
    Here's what you get when you split that string with <code>.split('')</code>
    (i added line breaks for readability, and spaces for it not to collapse back into Zalgo):
</p>
<p class="zalgo code">
    <code>C ̵ ͋ ̆ ̈́ ͊ ̌ ̒ ͌ ̫ ̖ ͚ ̗ ̣ ͖ ͚ ̦ </code><br>
    <code>r ̸ ͂ ͂ ̆ ̐ ̎ ̋ ̀ ̥ ͅ ̯ </code><br>
    <code>a ̸ ͐ ̅ ͂ ̳ ̜ ̠ ̹ ̪ ͈ </code><br>
    <code>z ̵ ͊ ̓ ̏ ̿ ͝ ͆ ̑ ̇ ̀ ̫ ̨ ̨ ̙ ̥ ̡ ̧ ̡ ͎ </code><br>
    <code>y ̶ ̓ ̐ ͘ ̓ ̎ ͜ ͙ ̦ ̰ ͎</code>
</p>
<p>
    <code>.split('')</code> clearly doesn't work with Zalgo.
</p>
<p>
    Ok you probably don't care much about Zalgo, so let's step a bit back and look at a
    simpler example.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="bigchar">💩</span>
</p>
<p>
    <code>"💩".length</code> → <code>2</code><br>
    <code>"💩".split('')</code> → <code>['\uD83D', '\uDCA9']</code><br>
    <code>[..."💩"].length</code> → <code>1</code><br>
    <code>[..."💩"]</code> → <code>['💩']</code><br>
</p>
<p>
    That's the Unicode symbol "U+1F4A9 PILE OF POO". Like all emoji, it's defined all the way
    up there in the Unicode supplementary planes (aka "astral planes"), meaning it's not part
    of the basic multilingual plane (BMP) and needs more than 2 bytes (or 16 bits) to be encoded.
    Javascript internally uses UTF-16, and thus needs two 16-bit code units to represent that
    character: <code>\uD83D</code> and <code>\uDCA9</code>.
</p>
<p>
    So there goes <code>.split('')</code>. It doesn't work here. In fact, most if not all of
    Javascript's String methods won't handle astral plane characters correctly.
    Luckily, in this case <code>Array.from("💩")</code> and the spread operator <code>[..."💩"]</code>,
    both introduced in ES6, do a good job.
</p>
<p>
    Takeaway: Only use <code>.split('')</code> if you are 100% certain that all strings you'll
    ever want to split will only contain characters from the BMP.
</p>
<p>
    We're not done yet, though. Let's look at another example:
</p>
<p>
    <code class="bigchar">&#x00E9;</code>
    <code class="bigchar">&#x0065;&#x0301;</code>
</p>
<p>
    That's two "e" characters with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent" target="_blank">acute accents</a>.
    As in "café". The French use them a lot.
</p>
<p>
    The two are semantically the same letter, but here they are encoded differently.
    Both versions are perfectly valid:
</p>
<p>
    <code>"é".length</code> → <code>1</code><br>
    <code>"é".split('').map(c => c.codePointAt().toString(16))</code> → <code>['e9']</code><br>
</p>
<p>
    <code>"é".length</code> → <code>2</code><br>
    <code>"é".split('').map(c => c.codePointAt().toString(16))</code> → <code>['65', '301']</code><br>
</p>
<p>
    Again, <code>.split('')</code> doesn't work here. It splits the string into two characters,
    <code>"e"</code> and U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT. Not even Array destructuring
    works here. It still splits the string into two characters:
</p>
<p>
    <code>[..."é"].length</code> → <code>2</code><br>
    <code>[..."é"].map(c => c.codePointAt().toString(16))</code> → <code>['65', '301']</code><br>
</p>
<p>
    What we can do though is convert the second version to the first one, using
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize" target="_blank">normalize()</a>:
</p>
<p>
    <code>[..."é".normalize('NFC')].length</code> → <code>1</code><br>
    <code>[..."é".normalize('NFC')]</code> → <code>['é']</code><br>
</p>
<p>
    We could be done here and just use Array destructuring after normalization, but there's
    another problem. Let's look at this:
</p>
<p>
    <span class="bigchar">🏳️‍🌈</span>
</p>
<p>
    <code>[..."🏳️‍🌈"]</code> → <code>['🏳', '', '', '🌈']</code><br>
    <code>[..."🏳️‍🌈"].map(c => c.codePointAt().toString(16))</code><br>
    → <code>['1f3f3', 'fe0f', '200d', '1f308']</code><br>
</p>
<p>
    What we have here are four Unicode symbols:
    <ul>
        <li>the Unicode symbol U+1F3F3 WAVING WHITE FLAG</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)" target="_blank">variation selector</a> U+FE0F</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner" target="_blank">zero-width joiner</a> U+200D</li>
        <li>the Unicode symbol U+1F308 RAINBOW</li>
    </ul>
    That's two emoji combined into one with a zero-width joiner.
</p>
<p>
    The family emoji <span class="emoji">👩‍👩‍👧‍👧</span> is another example of this. That's four emoji
    combined into one with a zero-width joiner. And there are many more of those.
</p>
<p>
    The only way we can split this natively into individual "characters" is by using
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Segmenter" target="_blank">Intl.Segmenter</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>const segmenter = new Intl.Segmenter('en', { granularity: 'grapheme' });
Array.from(segmenter.segment('🏳️‍🌈'), ({ segment }) => segment)
→ ['🏳️‍🌈']</code></pre>
<p>
    This splits anything we throw at it into individual graphemes, which is what we want.
    Bonus: You can also split strings into words or sentences.
</p>
<p>
    Small problem: Intl.Segmenter is
    <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_intl_segmenter_segment" target="_blank">not supported in Firefox</a>
    at the time of writing this.
    There is a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/intl-segmenter-polyfill" target="_blank">polyfill</a>,
    but it's a giant WASM thing, way too big for our casual client-side
    text splitting needs. So we'll have to wait for Firefox to catch up.
</p>
<p>
    There is <a href="https://github.com/flmnt/graphemer" target="_blank">Graphemer</a> though,
    a library that does splitting on graphemes. It's roughly 15kb minified and compressed, which
    is still a bit much, but it's better than megabytes.
</p>

<h3 id="intermission-tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>
    If you need to support joined emoji, use
    <a href="https://github.com/flmnt/graphemer" target="_blank">Graphemer</a>,
    or
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Segmenter" target="_blank">Intl.Segmenter</a>
    once it's available in Firefox.
</p>
<p>
    For most cases, <code>[...string.normalize('NFC')]</code> is a good solution.
    My split text library is going to use that by default, allowing you to pass in
    a custom splitter function if you like to use Graphemer, Intl.Segmenter or anything else.
